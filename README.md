# google-ump-react-native

[WIP] Google User Messaging Platform (UMP) for React Native

## Installation in managed Expo projects

For [managed](https://docs.expo.dev/archive/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects, please follow the installation instructions in the [API documentation for the latest stable release](#api-documentation). If you follow the link and there is no documentation available then this library is not yet usable within managed projects &mdash; it is likely to be included in an upcoming Expo SDK release.

## Installation in bare React Native projects

[TBC] For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `expo` package](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) before continuing.

#### Add the package to your npm dependencies

```
npm install google-ump-react-native
```

#### Configure for iOS

Run `npx pod-install` after installing the npm package.


#### Configure for Android
